The computer systems of N employees of a company are arranged in a row. A technical fault in the power supply has caused some of the systems to turn OFF while the others remain ON. Because of this, the employees whose systems are OFF are unable to work. The company does not like to see its employees sitting idle. So bh til the technical team can find the actual cause of the breakdown, the technical head Adam has devised a temporary workaround for the OFF systems at a minimum cost. Adam decides to connect all the OFF systems to the nearest ON system with the shortest possible length of cable. To make this happen, he calculates the distance of each system from the first
Input
The first line of the input consists of
an integer- systemState_size,
representing the number of systems
The second line consists of N space-
separated integers-
systemState[1j,
the initial state of esch syszern, ON
(1) or OFF
1 systemState_size, dist_size 105
1 109
1 i < dist size
Note
It is guaranteed that at least one
system is ON and none of the
systems are faulty.
Example
3
.nteger- dÉt_säe, the
number of distances (M).
Tt'k last line consists of M space-
separated integers
- dist[1J, representi
the distance of each system from
the first system.
Output
Print an integer representing the
minimum length of csble
Adam needs to systems
ON. If no cable is

computer systems of N
ernployees of a cornpany are
arranged in a row. A technical fault
in the power supply has caused
some of the systems to turn OFF
while the others remain ON.
Because of this, the employees
whose systems are OFF are unable
to work. The company does not like
to see its employees sitting idle. So
until the technical team can find the
actual cause of breakdown, the
technical head devised E
the minmurn length of able he
needs to wrn all tik systems ON.
Input
The first line of the input consists of
an integer- systemState_size,
representing the number of systems
The second line consists of N space-
separated integers-
systemState[1j,
the initial state of esch syszern, ON
(1) or OFF
1 systemState_size, dist_size 105
1 109
1 i < dist size
Note
It is guaranteed that at least one
system is ON and none of the
systems are faulty.
Example
3
.nteger- dÉt_säe, the
number of distances (M).
Tt'k last line consists of M space-
separated integers
- dist[1J, representi
the distance of each system from
the first system.
Output
Print an integer representing the
minimum length of csble
Adam needs to systems
ON. If no cable is
